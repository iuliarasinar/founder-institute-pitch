Only one file is *required* to create a GitPitch slideshow presentation, a **PITCHME.md** markdown file. This is the file where you add the markdown
content for your slides. Optional files, such as **PITCHME.yaml** and **PITCHME.css** can be added to activate custom settings and styles for your slide deck.
